I have been doing the fitness sport for approx. 10 years and I have
done a lot of mistakes that could've been avoided easily.

You know hot it goes. Overloaded by social media and personal free-time,
you consume everything you need and can know about the fitness and the science behind it.

If you're one of the good guys, you'll come across the fitness gods, mainly consisiting of [3DMJ(Dr. Eric Helms)](https://3dmusclejourney.com/),
[RP(Dr. Mike Israetel)](https://www.youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization/videos) and [SBS(Greg Nuckols and Eric Trexler)](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/). You know what is necessary to do and you know how to do what is
necessary to do. So what is it that keeps most people from reaching your goals?

### Understanding the pyramid

Eric Helms' wonderful pyramids give a concise, simplified picture of what to do, what to prioritize
and what to worry about. The pyramids show you should:

- Eat for your goals: caloric balance and macronurientes mean everything

      => Calories determine your weight

      => Protein is important(2g/kg), fat is essential(05.g/kg), carbs take the rest

- Not care about supplements

  => Most people do not notice their effects

- Have intense dates with weigths consistently that target your actual muscles.

  => Obvious (You have to train in order to train.)

- Not worry about exotic exercises variations and other detail-assed questions

  => This is not your problem probably

The problem I diagnose myself and folks with is not that they do not know
of how to play the game. We know it in detail. But we start to apply the **details in detail**
and kind of forget the bigger picture.

#### Example

You ask yourself how to perfectly individualize your bench press variation while you have barely been
progressing in any way of the bench press. The problem probably does not lie within the selected variation
but it is located lower in the pyramid. First check the bigger, more impactful checkboxes:

- [x]Do I eat enough?
- [x]Do I have sufficient sleep?
- [x]Am I actually showing up regularly?
- [x]Do I have a progress scheme?
- [x]Do I document my performance?

As long as you cannot tick these boxes, you should not give a damn about exercise variation and supplements.
You still can deal with them, but know that it is not what is responisble for your non-existing progress.

**Think of the lower layers of the pyramids as bottlenecks** for the progress made possible by implementing the above layers.
You can have perfect macronurient-distribution but if you eat only 1000kcal it won't grow your ass.
You can have the perfect ass-to-grass-3secs-negative-high-bar-ssb-squat but it won't do anything if you do it once a month.

Most people need to understand the pyramid not only as a fact of what the rules are but also
**distribute their attention to the more meaningful layers**. It is easy to not do that because of the unattractiveness of the basics and social media misery.
Documenting food intake and performance, following a scientific approach to training plan structure is responsible for most of your progress.
Taking creatine or making eccentric phases longer cannot really get you significantly more out of it.
No magic shit, no shortcut, just regularly squat, eat, repeat.

### Conclusion

The fitness thing is no rocket-science. It is relatively easy to know what to do, actually doing it requires some good structure.
It is beneficial to have fun doing it and fortunately, as long as you are doing the basic's basics, you're good to go lawl.

I could achieve the most progress when I was just focusing on the big lifts (being the powerlifting exercises), documenting them and eating as much as I want.
Having a like-minded training partner who was as hungry as me did also help(Thx Tim).
