I have never actually done the classic fitness if it means to casually show up in a fitness and "do something for your health".
Rather I was directly rawdawging the bodybuilding/powerlifting-thing.

### What does that mean?

You're deeper into that shit.
You know more than what is seen on the Gram and other influencer platforms.
You're familiar with terms like mesocycles, RPE, MRV and deload.
You know the gods of fitness science: Renaissance Periodization, 3DMJ, Stronger by Science.(Yes if you do not know all of them, you are not deep into it.)

How the game works is clear to you and you:

- collected noob-gains after a fairly short amount of time
- cannot be deceived by hilarious, periodically-reinvented new diets or training methods
- developed pity and a sense of superiority for your gym-fellows who are seemingly unable to look up for relevant information
- still can suck in progressing long-term

### Very short, incomplete list of the basic's basics

However, the fitness rules are pretty damn simple:

1. Showing up **consistently** is a must

   => actually do it

   => Your ass should be training the desired muscle at least once a week, taking care of nutrition the whole time (AHH!).

2. Energy-balance is the only dictator of long-term bodyweight

   => Calories in, Calories out was, is and will always be true(By definition)

   => Your energy demand (activity) must be higher/lower than your intake(calories) to lose/gain weight

3. Progressing in exercise is the only way of gaining strength/muscle

   => Progressing is a vaque term.

   => Can mean to increase exercise weight,repetitions,set,duration,difficulty.

4. Macro-nutrient distribution is important

   => Protein is really important.

   => You eat like 2g of protein per kg of BW and at least 0.5g of fat per kg BW. The rest is up to your preferences(preferably carbs).

5. Do _NOT_ care much for the other stuff.

   => Every addition from the "right food", exercise selection, supplements does matter so little, that it is irrelevant for 99% of people.

   => Nice to have but probably never the reason why you miss progress

Eric Helms, one of the gods, made these beautiful pyramids. It is about not giving a damn about what's up in the pyramid.
Rather, you should be focused on implementing the base of the pyramid, as that matters far more.

It is appropriate to think of the lower layers as bottlenecks for the progress possible by implementing the above layers.
It is worth nothing if you optimize nutrient timing as long as you're not eating any protein or not enough calories or some shit.
The same goes for crafting the perfect individualized exercise variation if you do not train it as often and intensive.
In fact, an exercise is pretty much useless, if you do not progress it over time.

### Understanding does not implicate implementation

It does not take much time and brain power to gain, understand and memoize the above list.
But ...actually doing it is a task many, inluding me, would fail easily.
In the real world, you are constantly bombed with the irrelevant stuff.
Social media, sometimes actual real-life people, mostly talk about:

- Supplements ("How much creatine should you take?"),
- Exercise variation and execution("Why dumbbell incline bench press with grip xyz is better than classic bench press!")
- Deeply detailed topics, where the big-dawged scientists don't have definitive answers("How close to failure should you optimally train?")

Distracted from those irrelevant and sometimes dumb questions, you care and implement minor tweaks and miss the fact that your actual struggles lie within the basics.
Hence, You are not reaching your goal because you do not execute the basics. Consume less of it,
go listen to the "Stronger By Science" podcast or watch Youtube Videos from Renaissance Periodization.

### Document your shit

In order to know if your actually being consistent (in doing the basics), documenting is fundamental.

- Have I made progress? Write it down
- Am I losing weight? Measure it and Write it down
- Why am I not gaining weight? Because I do not enough calories
- Am I eating enough calories? Count and document it.
- How to know if you have to make adaptations? You _must_ know the data

Doing that I was able to

- Reach 220kg Squat,130kg Bench Press, 225kg Deadlift.

  This is not impressive for a training career of 10 years and a guy casually bringing 85 to 105 kg of mass.

  I did that by training 4 times a week Powerlifting style with a documented training. No more than 10 different exercises.
  No fancy machines or supplements necessary.

- Dieting from 103kg to 87kg or from 96k to 84kg or 105kg to probably 88kg

  This is not impressive.

  You know your maintenance calories. You set a caloric deficit goal(eg. 1000kcal/d = 1kg weight loss/week). You count your calories and macros. You keep training.

- Look decent

### What I mean to say

The fitness thing is no rocket-science. It is relatively easy to know what to do, actually doing it requires some good structure.
It is beneficial to have fun doing it and fortunately, as long as you are doing the basic's basics, you're good to go lawl.

I could achieve the most progress when I was just focusing on the big lifts (being the powerlifting exercises)
and having nice sessions with a training partner who was as hungry as me (Thx Tim).
